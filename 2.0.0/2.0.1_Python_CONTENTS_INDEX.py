IMMEDIATE ACTION STEPS - GET STARTED RIGHT NOW!

1. CHOOSE YOUR PATH (2 minutes):
   - Quick Mastery: Need results fast â†’ Start with 2.0.0_Python_QUICK_REFERENCE.py
   - Comprehensive: Want deep understanding â†’ Start with this file, then 2.0.2
   - Interview Prep: Job focused â†’ Start with 2.0.0, focus on examples
   - Review Only: Experienced user â†’ Skip to advanced sections of 2.0.0

2. VERIFY SETUP (3 minutes):
   - Open terminal/command prompt
   - Type: python --version (or python3 --version)
   - Type: python (should show >>> prompt)
   - Type: exit() to leave interpreter

3. BEGIN LEARNING (varies by path):
   - Open chosen file in text editor
   - Have Python interpreter ready in separate window
   - Read section â†’ Try examples â†’ Take notes â†’ Move forward

4. TRACK PROGRESS:
   - Use assessment questions to check understanding
   - Complete practical tests for verification
   - Note areas that need additional practice
   - Schedule regular review sessions

SUCCESS GUARANTEE: Following any complete path with hands-on practice 
will result in solid Python interpreter mastery suitable for professional use.
